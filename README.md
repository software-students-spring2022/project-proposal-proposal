Project Name:
* NYU Marketplace

What:
* This app will allow NYU students to post items for sale. 
* Other students can see what items are being sold, and contact the seller to inqurie further.

Why:
* As college students, we would often like a secure way to: 
* Sell items we no longer need.
* Purchase items at a discounted price.
* This is especially true when it comes to stuff like textbooks, electronics, & other school supplies.

For Whom:
* All this could be done through a service like eBay or Facebook local marketplace, but this app connects NYU students with other NYU students, eliminating a significant amount of the risk/"can I trust this" factor.
* Since the market is strictly other students, it will also be easier to sell niche items like textbooks.
* In the future, the app could be updated to include other NYC schools as well. 

How:
* Users are required to sign-up with a NYU email. This makes it so the app is only limited to NYU students.
* Users can post items for sale. These posts include: item being sold, price, item description, contact info, and pickup location.
* Sellers can only set the pickup location as a NYU building, selected from an official list. This ensures a secure transaction.
* This list of NYU buildings will be extracted from NYU's website (Each NYU building has an unique code, found on their website).
* No actual transactions occur on this platform. The app solely aims to connects buyer and seller. 
* Method of payment is determined by the buyer/seller. The contact info under each post allows them to discuss this.
* Each user has a profile that includes: name, contact info, profile picture, description, year, location (WSQ / Brooklyn), etc.


Scope:
* The app has a strong list of features. One of its key selling points is security, which requires its features to be implemented well. There is always room to improve the app as well. In addition to the ones listed above, possible features include:
* A rating system of sorts: after each sale, both buyer & seller receive +1 confirmed sale. This rating will be displayed on their profile.
* A chatting system, so that buyers & sellers can chat on the app itself.
